        16.3 Notice . A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Claim (“Notice”). Any Notice to us should be addressed to: CEO, c/o Battlefy, Inc., Suite 1100, 11th Floor, 609 West Hastings Street, Vancouver, British Columbia V6B 4W4 (“Notice Address”). The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If we and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the Claim within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either party may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or us shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which you or we are entitled.

        16.4 AAA Rules . The arbitration will be conducted under and governed by the AAA Rules, except as specified in or modified by these Terms of Use. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by writing to the Notice Address. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of this Section 16. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide (as described further in subsection 16.5 below). The rules promulgated by the AAA concerning class arbitration shall not apply.

        16.5 Arbitrability . Notwithstanding the AAA Rules, the foregoing or any other provision of these Terms of Use (including the arbitration agreement), any disagreement or dispute concerning arbitrability (whether a particular Claim is arbitrable) or the scope of this arbitration agreement shall be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction in the Province of British Columbia. The arbitrator shall stay all arbitration proceedings pending a decision from the appropriate court on disputes under this subsection 16.5. The arbitrator shall follow, adhere to and defer to the decision, order, decree or judgment of the court following the court’s decision of any such dispute under this subsection 16.5. Any action, award or partial award of the arbitrator in contravention of this limitation may be the subject of court appeal by the aggrieved party. No other aspect of any ruling by the arbitrator shall be appealable, and all other aspects of the arbitrator’s ruling shall be final and non-appealable, except as set forth herein.

        16.6 WAIVER OF CLASS-WIDE PROCEEDINGS . You agree that, by entering into these Terms of Use, you and we are each waiving the right to participate in a class action or class arbitration. Each party to these Terms of Use agrees and covenants that it will not initiate any class-wide proceedings, including class actions or class arbitrations, against another party, and will not act as a class representative or class member. This provision constitutes an agreement that any Claim will be resolved exclusively on a bilateral basis between the parties, with each party acting in his/her/its individual capacity. Further, unless both parties agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. The arbitrator may award relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim. If for any reason the prohibition on class arbitration in this subsection 16.6 is not or cannot be enforced, then the agreement to arbitrate will not apply.

        16.7 Interpretation . These Terms of Use evidences a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration agreement shall survive termination of these Terms of Use.

        16.8 Location . The arbitration will be conducted in Vancouver, Canada, unless the parties agree to video, phone and/or internet connection appearances. The arbitrator shall be selected by mutual agreement of the parties within thirty (30) days of the effective date of the notice initiating the arbitration. If the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator, then the complaining party shall notify the AAA and request selection of an arbitrator in accordance with the applicable AAA Rules. The arbitrator shall have only such authority to award equitable relief, damages, costs, and fees as a court would have for the particular claim(s) asserted.

        16.9 Judicial Process . This arbitration agreement is not intended to modify or limit the remedies available to either party, including the right to seek interim relief, such as injunction or attachment, through judicial process, which will not be deemed a waiver of the right to demand and obtain arbitration.

        16.10 Severability . You and Battlefy agree that if any portion this Section is found illegal or unenforceable (except any portion of subsection 16.2), that portion shall be severed and the remainder of the Section shall be given full force and effect. If subsection 16.2 is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither you nor Battlefy will elect to arbitrate any Claim falling within that portion of subsection 16.2 found to be illegal or unenforceable and such Claim shall be exclusively decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the County of Los Angeles, State of California, United States of America, and you and Battlefy agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
